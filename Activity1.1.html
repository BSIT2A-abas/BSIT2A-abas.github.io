    <p>NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming. Especially if you&apos;ve never been. Luckily, I&apos;m here to give you an insider&apos;s guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut. You&apos;ll have an unforgettable experience!</p>
    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

    <p>If you&apos;re lucky or connected, you can get an invite sans the price tag. But I wasn&apos;t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I&apos;m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are the most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you&apos;re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won&apos;t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>    
    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don&apos;t you&apos;ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it&apos;s important to wear shoes you&apos;ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously, you want to look good, but you&apos;ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
